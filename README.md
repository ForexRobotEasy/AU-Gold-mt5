# AU Gold MT5 forex trading software

This code represents the AU Gold MT5 forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The purpose of this software is to enhance forex trades using logarithmic cycles. It utilizes various techniques and strategies, including weekly cycle analysis, integration of Elliott Wave Theory, calculation of Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, and risk management.

## Features

1. **Logarithmic Cycles**: The software determines open positions based on logarithmic cycles. It calculates alpha and beta for a ten-day cycle and determines intermediate trends using these values.

2. **Weekly Cycle Analysis**: The software analyzes weekly patterns to determine optimal entry and exit points. This analysis helps to identify potential market movements and trends.

3. **Elliott Wave Theory Integration**: The software integrates Elliott Wave Theory, a popular technical analysis approach, to forecast market movements. This technique helps in identifying potential price reversals and trends.

4. **Fibonacci Retracement and Extension Levels**: The software calculates Fibonacci retracement and extension levels. These levels are used to identify potential support and resistance levels and price targets.

5. **Risk Management**: The software includes risk management strategies to handle trades effectively. It determines open positions based on analysis and closes them if necessary, ensuring proper risk management.

6. **Efficient Trade Execution**: The software implements algorithms to ensure accurate and efficient trade execution. It handles trade execution timing and includes error handling mechanisms.
